# W3-Gwent-Checklist
A fun web-based project for the Gwent minigame in The Witcher 3

# About this program
This application is meant to be a tracker for all the collectible cards in The Witcher 3's minigame Gwent. It is both an encyclopedia of every card in the game, as well as a checklist someone can use to determine which cards they are missing. Each card contains information about it that a player should know, including its abilities, strength, and where the card can be obtained. Someone can search through this collection to find information about a certain card they want to know about, as well as selecting a card to view its properties.

There is also an integrated deck builder, which has all the rules as the one in the game. This can be helpful to create your own deck with both your current cards, as well as with cards you do not own.
